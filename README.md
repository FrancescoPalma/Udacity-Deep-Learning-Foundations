# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Foundations
**Project 1**
  
*INTRO*: This project was about building my first Neural Network to predict bike sharing rides based on the open-source dataset provided by UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset  
  
*PROBLEM*: Let's imagine you own a bike sharing company and you want to predict how many bikes you need because if you don't have enough, you are losing money from potential riders. If you have too many bikes, you're wasting money on bikes that will never be used.  
  
*WHAT TO DO*: You want to predict how many bikes you will need in the near future based on historical data. To do this, you have to build a Neural Network and train it on historical data to make predictions.  
  
*SOLUTION*: The solution - with code and detailed comments - is available as HTML file to run in any browser and/or as Jupyter Notebook.
